Are you an expert at drawing anime character? or how about surviving your first night in Minecraft? Well the time has come for you to make your contribution to the world of the open web and create a fine webpage tutorial using your HTML & CSS wisdom.
============================================================================ -->

<!--
Let's get started.

1) READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of this tag for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but instead is just text comments about the code. For this project, the comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding of what you are being asked to do.

2) GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title> Webstructable</title>
    <link href="//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Sue+Ellen+Francisco" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
    <link href="//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Press+Start+2P" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
  </head>

  <body>
    <div class="content">
<!--
Start by picking a topic! What would you like to teach others how to do? Add your own text in the <section> tag below.
-->
      <section id="logo">
        Give your tutorial an awesome name
      </section>

      <section id="narrative">
<!--
The <p> tag below stands for paragraph and is one of the most commonly used elements in HTML. We use it to write exactly what you would expect: paragraphs of text. Try editing the paragraphs, or even adding one or two more. Just remember to have both opening and closing paragraph tags like.
-->
        <p>Add some text</p>
        <p>Add another paragraph</p>
<!--
Now let's work with images. Images use the <img> tag which requires a src attribute which defines the URL where the image lives. Try changing out this image of an exploding bomb (who wants that anyway?) with one that matches your tutorial. To do this, go find the url of another image that you want on the Web, right click and copy the image address, and then replace the image url within <img> tag below. Note that <img> is one of the few weird tags that doesn't have a close tag.
-->
        <img src="/learning_projects/webstructable/pow.gif">
      </section>

      <section id="lesson">
<!--
Making your project should be as easy as 1, 2, 3! Let's use this opportunity to write an ordered list. Writing <ol> tells us that you are creating a list, and <li> tells us both the line number as well as what are the items in that list. Think of each <li> as the 1, 2, 3, etc. of your list. Change the text of the steps by replacing the text between the <li> tags below. Try adding a couple more steps to the list as well.
-->
        <ol>
          <li>Add Steps</li>
          <li>more steps</li>
          <li>some more steps</li>
          <li>...</li>
        </ol>
      </section>

<!--
Now let's work with videos. Videos work similar to images in that there is a src attribute that requires the URL to where the video is hosted. You can swap out the URL below with your own video. Hint: To embed a YouTube video in a webpage, find a video you like and click the "share" button, and then copy the URL and replace the src attribute below.

You may notice an <iframe> tag below - an iframe is a container used to pull in content from another webpage. In this case, you are pulling in video content.
-->
      <section id="video">
        <p>
          You have a video too!? Now we're talking!
        </p>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/kmk43_2dtn0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      </section>
    </div>


    <style>
/*
You've played with the text, now try tinkering with the look and feel of your page. To do so we will use CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and everything within the <style> tags is CSS. You can change values below to significantly change how your page looks. Look for HTML tags above to change the style of that element. For example to change style of the ordered list (<ol> tag in html) look for ol below. If you want to change the background-color of the entire <body> of the document, to say blue, look within the body styling below.
*/

      body {
        background-color: yellow;
        color: black;
        padding-top: 1em;
        font-family: "Press Start 2P";
        font-size: 20px;
        text-align: center;
        text-transform: uppercase;
      }

/* the next bit of CSS styles tags with class="content". The '.' refers to class */
      .content {
        margin-left: auto;
        margin-right: auto;
      }

/* Putting a # before something in CSS defines it as an id. Then you can say "id=" within various tags you pull in this style */
      #lesson {
        font-size: 38px;
      }

/*
The next code styles ordered lists <ol> in container tags (in the case of the above, its <section>) with id="lesson". The '#' refers to id.
*/
      #lesson ol {
        list-style-position: inside;
        margin-bottom: 0px;
      }
/*
Keep on moving down the hierarchy, this styles <li>, which are list items or bullets, in ordered lists that are contained within a container with id=lesson

      #lesson ol li {
        padding-bottom: 20px;
        padding-left: 20px;
        text-align:left;

        width: 300px;
        text-align: center;
        padding-left: 250px;
      }

      #video {
        position: relative;

      #video iframe {
        padding-top: 50px;

        left: 5%;

<!-- ==========================================================================
Your how to is complete - now if only you had a robot to try it out! You can try it out on a friend and make any necessary edits to get the instructions right. And don't forget you learned some pretty awesome stuff in all of this webmaking: you can now work with text in HTML including the <p> tag and ordered lists (<ol> tag), you can use images and videos, and you can start to understand and edit CSS.
