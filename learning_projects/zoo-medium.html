<!--
In this project, you can create you own unique, weird and totally bizarre Awesome Animal! We've drawn some of the world's most Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered animals (EDGE species) for you remix and hack together to create your own awesome animals! You'll do so by moving around the HTML for pieces of the real animals' pictures below into your own frame.
-->

<!--
Let's get started.

1) READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of this tag for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but instead is just text comments about the code. For this project, the comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding of what you are being asked to do.

2) GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

<!-- Before you build your own creature, read down through the other animals at the bottom of the page on the right. Each of the pictures on the right is made up of three parts. See if you can create a new species by taking parts from each of them and mixing them up! -->
    <body>

        <h1>Medium Awesome Animals</h1>

<!--
You can change the subheader to give your animal a name. Note that this one uses the <h2> tag instead of the <h1> tag used above. Play around with the tag to see what <h1> or <h3> looks like. Remember to close your tags appropriately!
-->

        <h2>Your own awesome animal</h2>

<!-- You can change the environment and habitat that your awesome animal lives (and the background of your picture) by changing the class below to "ocean", "rainforest" or "desert". -->

        <figure class="changeme">

<!--
Change these images by pulling in parts of the images below. You can do so by cutting and pasting the src attribute of the <img> tag from down below into the <img> tags here. The src attribute defines the URL for the image and is a required part of the <img> tag. Or you can just cut and paste the entire <img> tag. Note that the <img> tag is one of the few weird tags that doesn't need a close tag.

        <h3>About your Awesome Animal</h3>

<!-- Change the description of your animal here. Think about the animal's different attributes and qualities based on the pieces you selected. You can replace the text between the <p> tags with your own. The <p> tag is for paragraphs. Also note that the first sentence is enclosed in <strong> tags - note how this changes the text on the right. Experiment with moving the strong tags around. -->

        <p><strong>Write the description of your own animal here.</strong> Use the descriptions of the other animals below to help you, or make up something completely different!</p>

        <h4>My animal's cool features</h4>

<!-- And write about its cool features too! The <ol> tag is for ordered lists and the <li> tag represents each list item, or bullet. Change the text between the <li> tags to add your features.-->

    	<p>What are the interesting features and facts about your new animal?</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Feature one</li>
			<li>Feature two</li>
			<li>Feature three</li>
		</ol>

<!--
Congrats! You've built your animal and learned some stuff in the process! In addition to knowing more about some endangered species, oh and creating your own - you are now capable of wielding HTML to add, format and organize text (<p>, <h1>, <h2>, <ol>, <li>, <strong>, etc.) and work with images (<img>). You are a Webmaker AND an animal maker!

You might want to delete all the code below before you publish your new animal!

        <h3>About this Awesome Animal</h3>

        <p>Attenborough's long-beaked echidna is named in honour of Sir David Attenborough, the British broadcaster and naturalist. Long-beaked echidnas belong to an extremely unusual group of egg-laying mammals which numbers just five species. The ancestors of echidnas and their closest living relative, the duck-billed platypus, diverged from all other mammals more than 100 million years before Tyrannosaurus rex first appeared on the planet. The smallest and most threatened of the three long-beaked echidna species, Attenborough's echidna is known from a single individual collected in 1961. It was believed extinct until its rediscovery in 2007.Â It is known only from the Cyclops Mountains of Papua (Indonesian New Guinea) and is considered a tasty treat by hunters lucky enough to find one.</p>

        <h4>Cool features:</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Has spikes on its tongue to hook in prey</li>
            <li>Has a long snout perfect for finding insects in cracks and leaf litter</li>
            <li>Can lay eggs like a bird!</li>

<!-- This is all the information about the Camel -->

        </figure>

        <h3>About this Awesome Animal</h3>

        <p>This camel is probably the ancestor of all domestic two-humped camels. It is superbly adapted to life in the harsh Gobi Desert, one of the most hostile and fragile regions on the planet. The species can withstand drought, food shortages and even radiation from nuclear weapons testing. It is the only land mammal that can drink salt water with no apparent ill effects. Fewer than 1,000 individuals survive today in only four locations. Classified as Critically Endangered, these animals continue to be threatened by hunting, habitat loss, and competition for resources with introduced camels.</p>

        <h4>Red List Status: Critically Endangered</h4>

        <h4>Cool features:</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Can store fat in its humps which enables it to go for long periods without drinking</li>
            <li>Has double eyelashes to keep out sand</li>
            <li>Has large flat feet for walking across soft sinking sand</li>
        </ol>

        </figure>

        <h3>About this Awesome Animal</h3>

        <p>This endangered dolphin is the sole survivor of a once diverse group of dolphins that occurred across the world's oceans millions of years ago. They are extremely unusual looking with a needle-thin beak and tiny eyes that lack lenses. They swim on their sides and upside down and, being virtually blind, use finger-like projections on their fins to find food along the bottom of the rivers in which they live. Following the extinction of the Yangtze River dolphin, the Ganges River dolphin is now the most threatened freshwater cetacean species.</p>

        <h4>Red List Status: Endangered</h4>

        <h4>Cool features:</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Uses echolocation to detect food and navigate</li>
            <li>Has a blow hole to breath at the surface and dive down to swim</li>
            <li>Has a sleek aerodynamic body enabling it to swim fast in water</li>
