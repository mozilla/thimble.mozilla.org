<!-- =======================================================================
Everyone has an embarrassing moment. For the Web that moment was in the 90s. Back then websites were boxy and ugly - kind of like this page! Wrangle your HTML and CSS style powers to change the content, the colors and the layout so that this webpage doesn't feel like its stuck in the 90's anymore... To do so you will have to master CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets,and lets you add a touch of a style to your pages by giving you options to change. Any of the attributes that are within the <style> tags, are CSS.
========================================================================= -->

<!--
Let's get started.

1) READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of this tag for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but instead is just text comments about the code. For this project, the comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding of what you are being asked to do.

2) GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

      <style>
/* Everything between the <style> tags is CSS. Note the comments look different in CSS. CSS defines the look and feel of a site, so this is where you'll spend most of your time. It may feel overwhelming to figure out where to start, but just take it slow and change a few things here and there to start to modernize this page. If you get stuck, there is a sample design at the bottom of this page that you can use as a guide.
*/

/*
Start with the background; You can make it a solid color by using the background attribute. You'll want to delete or maybe replace the background-image attribute though! Try out some different colors or even replace the URL in the background-image attribute with an image from the web. You can search online to find interesting background tiles and use tools like: http://www.stripegenerator.com/ and http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/.

Once you have picked your new background image, check out the background-repeat attribute; this tells the background tile to repeat horizontally and vertically. Consider changing the alignment by editing the text-align attribute to either right, left or center.

        body {
          font-family: "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;

          background-repeat: repeat;
          text-align: center;
        }

/*
Part of the reason this page looks so boxy is because each section has a background color. Try removing the background color and the border attribute which also contributes to the boxiness of the page.
*/

        section {
          background: #87E8FF;
          border: 5px solid black;
          padding: 10px;
        }

        .content {
          background: #F30D00;
          padding: 20px;

/*
Tinkering with the attributes below might help this page look a little more modern. Remove the comment by deleting the slashes and asterisks from the code block below and see if this helps your page come out of the 90s.
*/

          /*
          margin-top: 20px;

Time to meet a long lost friend; Comic Sans, a font that was popularised in the 90s. Try replacing it with Georgia or another font of your choice. Find out more about open web fonts that you can use here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/font-family

Navigation in a web page is key; setting margin-left and margin-right to auto will center the element the style is set to. Change or delete these margins to move the navigation around.

        nav {
          width: 100%;
          margin-left: auto;
          margin-right: auto;

/*
When padding is used on multiple elements the underlying grid can get messed up. Check your padding attributes if things seem out of alignment.
*/
        nav a {
          font-size: 16px;
          text-decoration: underline;

/*
When we have a lot of pages on a website it is important to help users find their way around. We call these links breadcrumbs and they are an effective way to visually help a user with the location of landing pages. Try changing the breadcrumb text so it's not so big. Add a size attribute by typing "font-size:10px" and then adjust the pixels value to more or less .

          color: #800080;
          text-decoration: underline;

Typography is tricky business. You want to create visual unity within a page and having too many fonts breaks up unity. Try deleting or commenting out this font-family.

Try changing the width of the quote. Try deleting the width completely. What looks best? This style defines another font-family, this time a serif font. Maybe you want to change this too?

Congrats for making it this far! Is your page officially de-90'd? Here's a sample one that we did for fun: http://www.flickr.com/photos/77038325@N06/7316385630/. How is yours alike? Different? Can you go back through the CSS and figure out what you could do differently to make your page look like this?  You'll probably surprise yourself, you learned a lot in this project, especially how to wrangle CSS!
