<!-- 
Have you ever wondered how to create a basic pitch for an idea you have? In this project we've put together some useful questions to ask yourself when you're developing an idea for a product, service or campaign. They include questions about how your idea works, whether it's a product, service or campaign; why someone might want to use it; what its strengths and weaknesses might be and how well it might stack up against competition. Answering questions like these will help you develop a more complete sense of the viability of your idea. These questions will also help you to think about ways to communicate your brilliant idea to the world.

<!--
Let's get started.

1) READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of this tag for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but instead is just text comments about the code. For this project, the comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding of what you are being asked to do.

2) GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.
-->

<html>
  <head>
	<meta charset="utf-8">

<!-- 
First things first, let's change the text between the <title> </title> tags to the name of your idea. This text will appear at the top of the browser window and will let people easily find your page when they have many tabs open.
-->
    
        <title>My BIG Idea</title>
	<link href="/learning_projects/O2_thinkbig_pitch/pitch.css" rel="stylesheet">
  </head>
  <body>
	<div class="content_wrapper"> 
		<header>

<!-- 
Creating a unique look or identity for your idea is one of the most important aspects of a good pitch. Think about how you might do that with something like a logo. Using image editing or vector-based software, design something that is both attractive and representative. 

Upload the image to Flickr or any other photo sharing site. Then click "Share" and the choose the option to "Grab a link". Copy the link and paste it in the src value of the <img> tag. If you don't have a logo yet, you can leave this image as is.
-->

			<img src="/learning_projects/O2_thinkbig_pitch/O2_thinkbig.png"><br>
          
<!-- 
Now let's get down to some copyediting! We need a Super Awesome Title, one that will compliment your logo and grab someone's attention. Think of a catchy title, then dress it up with the underline <u> tags, the <strong> tags, and italic <em> tags individually or in various combos for maximum effect. 

Note: we have wrapped the text in the header 1 <h1> tags for the title, so it's larger and bolder than the other text and it really stands out. 
-->		

			<h1><strong>Super</strong> <u>Awesome</u> <em>Title</em></h1>

      		</header>

		<div class="video_placeholder">
			<div class="video_position">

<!-- 
Use a video on the page to bring your idea to life. You'll have to create one (or find one) first. 

Next you'll want to upload your video to a video sharing site like YouTube or Vimeo. Then get the embed code of your video by clicking on the "Share" link. Make sure to customize the size to 280 X 160, otherwise it won't fit here properly. 

Replace the <iframe> </iframe> tags with the new embed code. If you get a direct link to the video, you'll want to paste that into the src value of the <iframe> tag rather than replace the tags altogether.

Here's where you'll dive into the details of your product, service or campaign: the Description, How it works, Market Analysis and Target Audience. Use the questions under each section to spur your thinking. Questions indicated by [Q] and answers by [A] will help guide you through the code.

<!-- [A] -->

<!-- 
Replace the supplied text within the <p> tags with your own. 
-->              

				<p>
           			In the current economic crisis young people are finding it particularly difficult to find jobs. Because of the high ratio of applications to jobs they are often disappointed. In addition, companies are swamped with administration when dealing with the influx of CVs that come for job spaces. Our website, Recruit Able would be a members only website and forum for young people, facilitating the job search for them, and helping companies find the right applicant.
				</p>

<!-- 
Before moving on to the next question, remember the good old saying 'A picture is worth a thousand words'. Add an image to your pitch by replacing the URL in the src value of the <img> tag i.e. /learning_projects/O2_thinkbig_pitch/O2_image.jpg with a URL pointing to an image of your choice. First upload your image on Flickr. Then click the Share button above the image to grab the link generated and paste it in the src value. Similar options exist for other photo sharing sites as well. Copy this tag and paste in any answer to add an image.

           			It is useful for young people because they need coaching on how to present themselves in their CV, at a job interview, and what kind of jobs they might consider applying for, and can expect to be successful in.

You can make a list like this one or a paragraph using the <p> tags depending on how you choose to frame your answer.

				<ul>
					<li>As we are young people we have a network of friends in different schools and universities who could help us publicise this product.</li>
					<li>As we are in touch with our generation we will be able to stand out from other existing services from the perspective of the companies using us as a recruitment service.</li>
					<li>We can link the website into Facebook, Twitter and other social media, utilising our existing network of friends and appointing friends in other institutions as ambassadors to spread the word further.</li>
				</ul>

<!-- [Q] -->
		
				<h4>What are the threats to making your product/ service/ campaign a success?</h4>

<!-- [A] -->

<!-- 
Here you go, another great opportunity to practice lists! Soon you will be THE pro. 
-->

				<ol>
					<li>As we are not experienced in programming or developing a website it is possible that we do not develop a good product, and that we spend a lot of money on sorting technical problems.</li>
					<li>It is a trust based service, young people must trust us in order to commit to our service, and businesses must trust our expertise. It is possible that our youth is seen as a negative factor, and means both parties may not trust our skill in this area.</li>
					<li>The principle product, the website, cannot be built by us alone, we have to rely on external people, which may be costly, and is risky because we have less control over the quality of our product.</li>
