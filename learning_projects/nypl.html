===================================

Create your own webpages with the New York Public Library's exciting new Stereogranimator tool, which lets you transform old stereograph photos into true 3D images. Select images from the digital gallery and then add your own quotes and quips to make a 3D image with a humorous twist. Tweak images and edit HTML as you make the most of online humor!

Let's get started.

1) READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of this tag for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but instead is just text comments about the code. For this project, the comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding of what you are being asked to do.

2) GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <base href=".">
    <title>Stereograph Postcard </title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/learning_projects/nypl/nypl-style.css" type="text/css" charset="utf-8">
  </head>

  <body>

<!--
Start by changing up some of the text and images on the page. Remember that most elements require a pair of opening and closing tags. The <h1> tag below is a header tag - the "h" stands for header and the "1" stands for most important or top-level (versus <h2>, <h3>, etc.) Replace the text between the <h1> tags with a header of your own.

    <h1>Put on your 3D glasses</h1>

=================================================
Add a 3D image of your very own.
=================================================

Step 1: Go to http://stereo.nypl.org/

Step 2: Click “Start Creating!” and then select a photo for your card. If you don’t like any of them, you can press “refresh photo list” on the bottom of the page, or search for a particular term in the box above.

Step 3: When you find the photo you want, click on it.  The next page will allow you to transform the doubled stereograph image into an animated gif or a true 3D image (anaglyph). To make the 3D image (glasses required), select the "View as 3D anaglyph" option above the preview. When you've got your preview the way you want it, click "Save Image".

Step 4: You should be on a page with your completed image. There is a white square with code in it in the middle of the page. Highlight and copy this code with CTRL+C (or Command+C for macs)

Step 5: Paste in the code from your 3D creation below. (The HTML should look just like the code in the <a href> below.

    <a href="http://stereo.nypl.org/view/34640">
      <img alt="ANAGLYPH made with the NYPL Labs Stereogranimator - view more at http://stereo.nypl.org/gallery/index"
           src="/learning_projects/nypl/34640.png">
      <br>
      ANAGLYPH made with the NYPL Labs Stereogranimator
    </a>

<!--
Let's unpack what's going in on that <a> tag above a little more before moving on. The <a> tag is used for hyperlinks and anything between the <a> and </a> is what shows up linked on the page. In this case, the there are two things that are linked: 1) an image, defined by the <img> tag, and 2) some text. Let's look at the <img> first. The key attribute of the <img> tag is the src, which is a URL that points to the image you want to use. Note that this <img> also has an alt attribute which is the text you'll see if you hover your mouse over the image. That's a great thing to include so that screenreaders can understand your images.

There is also <br> tag after the <img> which stands for "break" and puts a line break in. It's one of those weird tags that doesn't take a closing tag (non-closing tags are also known as a "void elements"). Because of the <br>, the text will show up under the image, and it will also be hyperlinked because it is still inside the <a> tags.

Now it’s time to start quipping! Create a funny or witty one liner that describes your image or message. Need some help? Head over to http://knowyourmeme.com or http://memegenerator.net/ and see what else is out there. Are you going for funny? Serious? Witty? Try your hand at writing by editing the text in the paragraph (defined by the <p> tag) below.

/* 
===============================================
Change the background and style of your webpage
===============================================

Everything inside the <style> tag is called CSS and is used to define the look and feel of your page. Here you will see that the black striped background is actually an image. You can replace that image with something else by looking for the "background-image" CSS property. If you don't want to change the image, consider tinkering with some of the other CSS properties here. You can delete the image, or change the color of the text.

You've completed this project! Way to go, Webmaker! Let's take a minute to reflect back on everything you learned in the process: how to work with text (<h1>, <p>, etc) and images (<img>) in HTML, how to make a 3D image, how to add links (<a>) and even how to work with some CSS.
