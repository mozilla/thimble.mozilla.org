<!--
Work with members of your Born Brave Nation (BBN) to show your community what you stand for. Design a webpage for people to learn about the resources available to share kindness locally. And as a bonus, learn the HTML & CSS that goes into making the page. List the resources, add some photos, embed a tweet or a local google map. Get it all together and put it out there.
-->

<!--
Let's get started.

1) READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of this tag for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but instead is just text comments about the code. For this project, the comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding of what you are being asked to do.

2) GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for. Each tag has a beginning defined as <p> and an end defined as </p>
-->

<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">

<!--
The text within the <title> </title> tags will help people easily identify the page when it is minimized or open in one of many tabs. Since your page is for a local audience, let's customize the title to include the name of your city, town or community. Replace the text below with appropriate content for your area.
-->

  <title>Born Brave Manhattan</title>
  <link href='/learning_projects/BTWF_campaign/btwf_campaign.css' rel='stylesheet'>

</head>

<body>
  <img src="/learning_projects/BTWF_campaign/btwf_logo.png">

  <div class="content_wrapper">

<!--
Next, let's edit the page header. Replace the text within the <strong> </strong> tags with the name of your city, town or community. To make any part of the text stand out from the rest of the content try adding the <strong> </strong> tags around it. Remove the <strong> </strong> tags to see the difference they make. Then, if you like, add them back in.
-->

    <header>Kind and Brave Resources in <strong>Manhattan</strong></header>
    <img src="/learning_projects/BTWF_campaign/btwf_stamp.png" class="stamp">

    <div class="left">

<!--
This is where you will share your master list of resources, and coincidentally, where you'll master the art of formatting text using the paragraph <p> </p> and linebreak <br> tags. Replace the text within the <p> </p> tags with the information you want to share.

Use the <br> tags wherever you want to have the text break to the next line. Note: The <br> tag does not have a closing tag. And can be placed just about anywhere. Use two <br> tags in a row to get a blank linespace. In the example below, each line starts with a <br> except where it is meant to be a continuous line of text.

Leverage the power of social networks to further your cause. You can keep the community tuned into ongoing activities and available resources by working with your Born Brave Nation members to create a local Facebook page or Twitter account. And you can periodically revisit this page to update it with new content.

A nice plus: add a contact email for people to get in touch. Link to these in the respective <a> tags below.

Make a short announcement here. You could embed a tweet or write a short message related to a particular activity that you want people to know about. To embed a tweet, you'll need a Twitter account. First click on the tweet in your Twitter account to get an expanded view then select "details" appearing under it. On the Details page, click on the link to "Embed this tweet." Copy the code and paste it between the start and end embed comments replacing the existing code.

<!-- Start embed code for tweet -->

Add an image of bravery, acceptance or love to your page by replacing the <img> tag below. It would be a good idea to first upload your image(s) to Flickr. Then choose the image you want to use, click "Share" and select the option to "Grab the HTML/BBCode". Copy the code and paste it here to replace the existing <img> tag. Then remove the link <a> </a> tags surrounding the <img> tag so that the image is not clickable.

Similar options will exist for other photo sharing sites. Once you get the hang of it, feel free to add more images to the page.

Note: Crop or resize the image to a width of 250px wide so it properly fits the existing layout on this webpage.

Lastly, it's great to share an inspiring quote or excerpt. Replace the text between the alphanumeric character strings &ldquo; and &rdquo;. This combination of letters and symbols indicates to the browser that it should render opening left quotation marks and closing right quotation marks.

There are certain special characters and symbols that cannot be generated by HTML when typed directly from a keyboard. Quotation marks are one of them. &ldquo; produces left double quotes and &rdquo; produces right double quotes. Swap these out for &lsquo; and &rsquo; to change the double quotes to singles quotes.

These are also known as "named character references" or "HTML entities." Notice in the authors name below the HTML entity &aacute; renders a lower case "a" with acute accent. Learn more here - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Introduction
