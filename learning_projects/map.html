<!doctype html>

<!-- =========================================================================
As you might have noticed by looking at this page, HTML is a funny looking language; it is written inside brackets like <this> and </this>. In this project you will begin your journey in the world of Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) by exploring the syntax behind it to activate and customize a broken Map. Use the comments that are marked in between these brackets to navigate yourself along your web travels!
============================================================================ -->

<!--
Let's get started.

1) READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of this tag for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but instead is just text comments about the code. For this project, the comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding of what you are being asked to do.

2) GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

-->

<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    
<!-- 
Start by changing the <title> element to one for your map. Typically, the title will show up at the top of your browser window and will be searchable in search engines like Google. In Thimble, the title shows up in the tab above the preview pane on the right side of the editor.
-->  
   
    <title>Hack a Map</title>

<!--
These <link> tags pull in additional style sheets for things like fonts, etc. You'll see some CSS below in the <style> tag that you can edit directly.
-->
    <link href="//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Sue+Ellen+Francisco" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
    <link href="//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Press+Start+2P" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
    <link href="/learning_projects/map/arcademap_styles.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
  </head>
  
  <body>
    <div class="content">
      <section id="logo">
<!--
Uh-oh, this part of the map is broken! Can you fix the issue below. Hint: Remember that tags have an open and a close tag. The <h1> tag is a header tag and "h" stands for "header" and "1" stands for most important, or top level. After you fix it, go ahead and change the header to add a new name for your map.
-->
        <h1>Name Your Map
      </section>
      
      <section id="notes"></section>
      <section id="island01">
<!--
While almost all tags need an open and a close tag, <img> tags are special because they don't need a close tag. All of the information the browser needs to show the image is defined in the attributes.
-->
        <img class="forest" src="/learning_projects/map/forest1.png">
        <img class="mountains" src="/learning_projects/map/mountain1.png">
        
<!--
Changing the images on your map is as easy as replacing the url with another image of your choice. You may want to make this a map of your neighborhood, social network or favorite vacation place. If you are looking for images a good place to start is http://search.creativecommons.org/. Here you can find images that are available under the Creative Commons licenses. To get the link for the image, either right click/CTRL click and Copy Image Address, or in Flickr, click "Share" and copy the link. 
-->
        <img class="tower" src="/learning_projects/map/rabbit.gif" >
        <img class="tower02" src="/learning_projects/map/minecraft-pig.jpg" width="50px">
        
<!-- 
Oops! Here is another issue. Can you fix it? Hint: tags must have an open and close tag. Once you are done go ahead and fix any other elements that look broken. The <h3> tag is another header tag, the "h" stands for header and the "3" for the level (so its less important than <h1> or <h2> but more important than <h4>). Try changing the name of the location by editing the text between the <h3> tags. 
-->
        <h3>
          Rescue Tower
        /h3>

      </section>
      
      <section id="island02">
        <img class="forest" src="/learning_projects/map/forest1.png">
        <img class="forest2" src="/learning_projects/map/forest2.png">
        <img class="mountains" src="/learning_projects/map/mountain2.png">
        <img src="/learning_projects/map/kittyloaf.gif" width="100px">

<!-- This location doesn't have a name. You can fix that by adding text between the opening and closing h3 tag. -->
         <h3 class="kitty"></h3>

<!-- More errors below. You are a pro now, you'll have them fixed in no time! -->
         <h3 class="famous">
           Serious Cat Town
         /h3>
         
         <img class="famous" src="/learning_projects/map/goggles10.jpg" width="100px">
         <h3 class="rainbow">Triple Rainbow 
         <img class="rainbow" src="/learning_projects/map/rainbows.png">
      </section>
    </div>
        
       <style>
/*
CSS is used to define the look and feel of a website -- for example what color the background and the text should be. We will learn more about CSS in more advanced projects like Stuck in the 90's, but for now try changing the property that says `background-color` below to another color, like red or blue.
*/

      body {
        background-color: black;
/*
Now try doing the same thing with the text, by changing the funny combination of letters and numbers that look like this #ffffff below. This combination has a funny name: “hexadecimal”. In CSS it begins with a # followed by a combination of numbers (0 to 9) and letters (A through F). The numbers represent the amount of red, green and blue to combine in order to make a color. It might help to think of it as mixing colors in three pairs. #ff0000, for example is red because it has the highest red value (ff), and no blue or green. Similarly, #00ff00 is green and #0000ff is blue. #ffffff is white. #000000 is black. Play with this number and give the text a different color. Try #ffbbff!
*/
        color: #ffffff;
        padding-top: 1em;
      }

	  h1 {
	   font-family: "Press Start 2P";
	   font-size: 16px;
	   color: #fff;
	   left: 77px;
	   position: relative;
	   top: 18px; 
	  }
    </style> 
  </body>
  
<!-- ========================================================================
Congrats! You've fixed the map and maybe even customized it! You can always go back and change it - that's the beauty of the Web. Don't forget that you learned some new skills in this project too - you can now change the page title, spot and correct issues with HTML tags, use header tags to organize your content, insert images (<img> tag) and even change some of the styles within CSS. Way to go Webmaker!
