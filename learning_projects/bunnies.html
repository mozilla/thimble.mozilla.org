             SAVE THE BUNNY?

      
    Will you add a shield to protect him? 
    Move him out of the way?
    Or will you show what might happen next?!

    You can add more images by putting "img"s in the scene near the bunny and the masher <img> tags below (past line 127) and giving them
    id's, something you can use to refer to it in the style. Just copy the way it is done already for the masher and the bunny,
    but change the 'id' to be your own name for it and the 'href' to point to the image you want!
    
    Then copy the style code below and put it just under the #worried_bunny style section above, changing 'anotherimage' for the name you picked. 
    
    Change the numbers and move it around!

        How this works
        --------------
        
        The page is made up of three 'div' elements, named the 'wall', the 'scene', and the 'explanation'. These are
        contained within a single 'div' element called 'content' to make the positioning of these elements easier.
        
        The 'wall' is the background, and contains the words 'SAVE HIM', the greenish background and the
        image for the floor.
        
        The 'scene' is next, and it contains the bunny and the masher, as well as any images you might have added there.
        
        The final part is the 'explanation', which contains the text underneath everything.
        
        If you remove the styling from the 'scene' element (by renaming it for example), you should be able to see
        that instead of being over the wall images, it is put under it. This is how it would normally work!
        
        The styling tells the browser to position the 'scene' tag absolutely, and to move it 550 pixels
        upwards, from where it would have been (due to "top:-550px;"). Note that you have to also have to tell the
        browser to move it left or right an amount for it to position it correctly, even if you aren't going to
        move it at all - "left: 0px;" is needed too in this example!
        
        The div element 'content' (which contains the three parts above) must also be set to 'relative' positioning, 
        which lets you tell the browser how to position all the elements as you want them.
