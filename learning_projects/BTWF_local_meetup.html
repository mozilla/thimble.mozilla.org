<!--
Work with members of your Born Brave Nation (BBN) to create a webpage inviting people to your nation's local meetup or community activity while learning the HTML & CSS that goes into making the page. Add a video, embed a tweet and share via social media to spread the word.
-->

<!--
Let's get started.

1) READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of this tag for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but instead is just text comments about the code. For this project, the comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding of what you are being asked to do.

2) GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for. Each tag has a beginning defined as <p> and an end defined as </p>
-->

<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">

<!--
The text within the <title> </title> tags will help people easily identify the page when it is minimized or open in one of many tabs. Since your page is for a local audience, it would be a good idea to customize the title to include the name of your Born Brave Nation along with the local event or activity. Go ahead and modify the text with your information.
-->

  <title>Be Myself T-Shirt Day by Brooklyn Nation</title>
  <link href='{{ HTTP_STATIC_URL }}BTWF_local_meetup/btwf_local.css' rel='stylesheet'>

</head>

<body>
  <img src="{{ HTTP_STATIC_URL }}BTWF_local_meetup/btwf_logo.png">

  <div class="content_wrapper">

<!--
Next, let's edit the page header. Replace the text within the <header> tags so it reflects your local event or activity. To make any part of the text stand out from the rest of the content try adding the <strong> </strong> tags around it. Remove the <strong> </strong> tags to see the difference they make. Then, if you like, add them back in.

Now, let's replace the text within the header <h5> tags to include the name of your Born Brave Nation. If you are not a member of a BBN, don't worry, just fill in the content that you'd like to see here.
-->

    <header>Be Myself <strong>T-Shirt</strong> Day</header>
    <h5>Organized by the Brooklyn Nation</h5>
    <img src="{{ HTTP_STATIC_URL }}BTWF_local_meetup/btwf_stamp.png" class="stamp">

<!--
This is where you can share the details of your event including the time and day. Replace the text within the paragraph <p></p> tags. And add line breaks using the <br> tag. (Note: The <br> tag does not have a closing tag. And can be placed just about anywhere. Use two <br> tags in a row to get a blank linespace.) For now, just ignore the <div> tags.
-->

    <div class="left">
      <p>
        Join us at Brooklyn School for a community event calling all young people to step out of their comfort zone and proudly display their unique qualities on a personalized t-shirt. Help to bridge the gap between different cliques and groups in your community by showing how similar we all really are to each other.
      </p>

      <p>
        Date: Sunday Dec 20
        <br>Time: 9am
      </p>

<!--
Leverage the power of social networks to spread the word. Work with your Born Brave Nation members to create a local Facebook page and Twitter account to keep the community tuned into ongoing activities. Also add a contact email for people to get in touch. Link to these in the respective <a> tags below.
-->
      <div class="social">
        <a href="Facebook link here"><img src="{{ HTTP_STATIC_URL }}BTWF_local_meetup/btwf_fb.png"></a>
        <a href="Twitter link here"><img src="{{ HTTP_STATIC_URL }}BTWF_local_meetup/btwf_twitter.png"></a>
        <a href="Email link here"><img src="{{ HTTP_STATIC_URL }}BTWF_local_meetup/btwf_email.png"></a>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="right">

<!--
Show people what it's all about, it could be a short clipping of a past event or a similar one. To embed a video on the page, first you'll need to upload your video to a video sharing site like YouTube or Vimeo. Then get the embed code of your video by clicking on the "Share" link. Make sure to customize the size to 400 X 225, otherwise it will not appear correctly on this webpage. Replace the content within <iframe> </iframe> tags with the new embed code. If you get a direct link to the video instead of an embed code, paste it in the "src" value of the <iframe> tag, making sure that you have it enclosed within quotation marks, like the one below.
-->

      <div class="topright">
        <iframe width="400" height="225" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/V_xp6AhwB_Y?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      </div>

      <div class="bottomright">

<!--
Lastly, consider embedding a tweet or writing a short message to update people about the activity. To embed a tweet, you'll need a Twitter account. First click on the tweet in your Twitter account to get an expanded view then select "details" appearing under it. On the Details page, click on the link to "Embed this tweet." Copy the code and paste it between the start and end embed comments replacing the existing code.
-->

  <!-- Start embed code for tweet -->
        <div class="twitter-tweet"><p>#BTWFbrooklyn Be Myself T-shirt Day at Brooklyn School this Sunday at 9am
        </p>@bbnmember</div>
  <!-- End embed code for tweet -->

        <div class="twittericon"><img src="{{ HTTP_STATIC_URL }}BTWF_local_meetup/btwf_twitter_icon.png"></div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<!--
Fantastic! You have successfully created a webpage that you can use to invite people to a local event or activity. You also learned how to use some essential HTML tags including <p>, <br>, <strong> to format the text on this webpage. Not only that, you learned how to embed a tweet and a video, too. Bravo!
