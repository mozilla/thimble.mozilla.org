## Moving to Glitch page ##
###########################

movingToGlitchHeader=We’re excited to partner with Glitch to continue supporting the open web
mtgIntroParagraph1=Mozilla has made a strategic decision to sunset Thimble over the course of 2018-2019. To continue supporting our Thimble community, we have partnered with <a href="https://glitch.com/about/company/" target="__blank">Glitch</a>. <a href="{{ glitch.moreInfoURL }}">Read our blog post</a> to learn more about this partnership.
mtgIntroParagraph2=To make this process simple for you, we have answered some common questions you might have. If you don’t find your question here, feel free to <a href="{{ glitch.supportEmail }}">contact us</a> and we’ll be happy to chat with you.
mtgFAQ=FAQ
mtgWhatToDoHeading=What do I need to do?
mtgWhatToDoText=We encourage you to export your projects over to Glitch. In the project list, you can transfer each project individually. Don’t forget to do this by {{ migrationDate }}.
mtgWhatIsGlitchHeading=What is Glitch?
mtgWhatIsGlitchText=Glitch is a creative community that gives you the tools to create any app or website that you can imagine — and it's <strong>free</strong>! Like Thimble, it allows you to remix and tweak web projects to learn and build new content and put your own spin on it. <a href="https://glitch.com/about/">Click here</a> to learn more about Glitch and what it can do.
mtgIsGlitchAvailableHeading=Is Glitch available in my language?
mtgIsGlitchAvailableText=Currently Glitch is translated in English. However, the Glitch team is committed to supporting more languages soon.
mtgWillMyProjectWorkHeading=Will my Glitch project work the same way as it does on Thimble?
mtgWillMyProjectWorkText=Once you export your project to Glitch, you should expect a few differences from Thimble:
mtgWillMyProjectWorkBullet1=Glitch advocates for openness on the web. This means that when you export your project, both the project and the code will be live and public by default. Before you export your project, you will be asked if you want to export the published or the work-in-progress version. If you need to, you can <a href="https://glitch.com/help/privateproject">make your project’s code private</a>.
mtgWillMyProjectWorkBullet2=Tutorial files are regular files on Glitch. You will need to open the tutorial file in your live project to see the tutorial.
mtgWhatHappensAfterHeading=What happens to my project on Thimble after I export it over to Glitch?
mtgWhatHappensAfterText=Your project will still remain in Thimble, and if published, the live link will still be active. However, all projects and user accounts will be deleted by {{ migrationDate }}.
mtgCanIKeepThimblingHeading=Can I continue using Thimble until I export over my projects?
mtgCanIKeepThimblingText=Absolutely! But, we will be turning off features in Thimble over the course of the year. Here’s our timeline for shutting down services:
mtgRoadmapDate1=<strong>{{ glitch.roadmapDate1 }}</strong> - Turn off creating new accounts
mtgRoadmapDate2=<strong>{{ glitch.roadmapDate2 }}</strong> - Turn off publishing and creating new projects
mtgRoadmapDate3=<strong>{{ glitch.roadmapDate4 }}</strong> - All projects, user accounts, and published projects will be deleted and Thimble will be offline
mtgStorageHeading=How much storage do I get for my project on Glitch?
mtgStorageText=On Thimble you got 5MB of storage. On Glitch you’ll have up to 200MB!
mtgCostHeading=How much does Glitch cost (and will it always be free)?
mtgCostText=Glitch is free to use. There are some <a href="https://glitch.com/help/restrictions" target="__blank">resource restrictions</a> and we expect charges for premium services or capabilities in the future, but the stuff you can do now will remain free.
mtgCreateAccountHeading=How do I create an account on Glitch?
mtgCreateAccountText=Check out this <a href="https://glitch.com/help/how-do-i-create-an-account-on-glitch/" target="__blank">handy video</a>!
mtgManageProjectsHeading=How do I manage my projects on Glitch?
mtgManageProjectsText=Once you create an account, all your projects will be listed under your profile, ready to edit!
mtgPrivacyHeading=How does Glitch handle my data?
mtgPrivacyText=You can find Glitch's terms of service and privacy policy <a href="https://glitch.com/legal/" target="__blank">here</a>. If you have any questions, feel free to <a href="https://support.glitch.com">reach out to the Glitch team</a>.

mtgIHaveMoreQuestionsText=First, check out Glitch’s <a href="https://glitch.com/help">Help Center</a>. If you can’t find an answer there, search or post your question on Glitch’s <a href="https://support.glitch.com">Support Forum</a>.

twigz20Contrib1=Added a code snippets menu to make coding easier
twigz20Contrib2=Fixed JavaScript auto toggle bugs
twigz20Quote=“When first starting on Thimble I had little to no experience/knowledge of JavaScript. It took me a while to get my bearings. As I started working on this project I had many hurdles to cross. But with the help of the core team I was able to slowly cross those hurdles. I still have lots to learn, but I'm happy with the progress so far!”
sanariaz154Contrib1=Added extra padding to the Editor to improve legibility
sanariaz154Quote=“We all need people who will give us feedback. That's how we improve. Working with Thimble was the most encouraging experience for me in opensource world and it gave me a chance to work with most friendly and supporting team.”
raygervaisContrib1=Added a JavaScript console to help learners to debug their code and find errors
raygervaisContrib2=Improved the usability of Thimble menus
raygervaisQuote=“Contributing to Thimble enabled me to learn about modern JavaScript web applications, an experience which has already helped further my career to new heights and possibilities. Open Source has changed the world, and with it, I believe we can do anything.”
hkiratContrib1=Created a custom UI to edit parameters for A-frame tags
hkiratContrib2=Made code completion an optional setting
hkiratContrib3=Researched tech approaches to collaborative editing
hkiratQuote=“Working on Thimble has been a great experience. The code is very well written and the mentors are really supportive. It is one of the best projects to work in if you want to start working on open source and contributing has taught me a lot about open source best practices.”
cgsinghContrib1=Added descriptions to projects page
cgsinghContrib2=Made auto closing tags an optional setting
cgsinghContrib3=Fixed a longstanding usability bug with the Publish button
cgsinghQuote=“Jumping into Thimble the first time around was daunting. But then I started to contribute, and it became satisfying. I learned a lot about what I usually sidelined &mdash; web development. In Open Source development, I never felt alone. Bring all these talented minds together, and something as great as Thimble can happen.”
peiying16Contrib1fix=Added support for file icons in the file list
peiying16Contrib2=Fixed bug related to JavaScript settings
peiying16Contrib3=Support for editing SVG files right in the editor
peiying16Quote=“I love Thimble, and I love fixing bug with Thimble team.”
th30Contrib1=Updated menu transition effects
th30Contrib2=Made sure files are properly highlighted in the editor
th30Quote=“Working with Thimble proved to be challenging and explosive way to get into open source. It really made me collaborate and work with some amazing individuals, which always made you feel like your mistakes are merely opportunities to further improve your releases. Persistence is key, and always turn feedback into a lesson opportunity!”
omytryniukContrib1=Improved the built-in image viewer UI
omytryniukContrib2=Added several UI improvements and fixed front-end styling and functionality bugs
omytryniukContrib3=Updated node dependencies in the Thimble project
omytryniukQuote=“For me, working on Thimble is not just about gaining valuable programming experience but more importantly a feeling of accomplishment and contributing to a product that is used by people all around the world. Realizing that millions of people benefit from the code I write is what drove me to apply to work on Thimble. The other important factor is the friendly and supportive community within the project which is another reason that makes my open source development experience with Thimble fascinating.”
timmoyContrib1=Fixed a bug related to the auto-refresh setting on the preview panel &mdash; it now remembers the setting when the browser is refreshed
timmoyContrib2=Added a feature that lets you add filters to images in a project
timmoyQuote=“Prior to Thimble, I worked with relatively small programs that I coded myself or in a small group. Working on code that spans hundreds (probably thousands!) of files being worked on by over 300 people definitely opened up my mind in what “working with others” could mean. I found that there is definitely a learning curve to get used to the environment, but there's always friendly faces that will help you get started as well as with troubles you may have along the way. Just after a few months, I'm able to contribute to the community more than I imagined before. Imagine the possibilities that we can all achieve together as open source continues to grow!”
