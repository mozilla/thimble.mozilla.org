Please check the following items before submitting a PR -- thank you!

Note that this project is released with a Contributor Code of Conduct.
By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.
[Contributor Code of Conduct](https://voxpupuli.org/coc/).

- [ ] There is no existing PR that addresses this problem
- [ ] Mentioned any existing issues in your commit so they get linked and
  closed once this PR gets merged, i.e: `Closes #1554` in the body of a commit
- [ ] Followed the instructions in the [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) document
- [ ] Ran the unit/spec tests and ensured they still pass
- [ ] Added tests to cover the new behaviour
- [ ] Updated the documentation to match the changes
- [ ] When possible, add an entry to the CHANGELOG file
- [ ] Squashed your PR down to a single commit. You may forego this if the PR
  tries to address multiple issues. Though we prefer one PR per feature/fix,
  sometimes that's not feasible. In that case ensure that a single feature/fix
  and associated tests and documentation is bundled up in one commit

Optional, but extra points:

- [ ] Added tests to ensure the old behaviour cannot accidentally be
  reintroduced
